Father of two girls. The seeds of my spiritual journey were planted at university where I discovered meditation. But the real work began when I hit a rock bottom that led me to 12 step recovery. </p><p> I know now that suffering has been my soul&#39;s greatest teacher, and that there is spiritual gold hidden within all of life&#39;s greatest challenges. </p><p> I have come to learn that we all have the freewill to choose our own perspective on our lives and on the circumstances we find ourselves in on a daily basis. However if we feel stuck and at a low ebb, it is a huge hurdle to see any other perspective than struggle and pain. </p></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-5"><img src="'+s+'" style="width:100%;"></div></div></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="section-bg-colour"><div class="container py-5"><div class="row justify-content-between py-5"><div class="col-12 col-md-5"><img src="'+a+'" style="width:100%;"></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6"><div class="text-primary title">Energy Healing</div><div class="fs-5"><p> I offer the same that has been given to me by my teachers within the spiritual traditions of Buddhism and Shamanism, and also through the healing powers of Reiki. Over the past 15 years I have attended yearly silent meditation retreats, sitting with my own suffering and cravings, turning inwards to face my own shadow with a heart of compassion and light. </p><p> More recently I have had the honour of experiencing a Kundalini awakening, leaving me without doubt of the power of energy healing and using this universal resource as a way out of despair. </p><p> It is when we come together to heal with energy that magic does happen. I have seen first hand how Reiki gets right to the root of emotional trauma, something that otherwise can take years in talking therapy. Reiki needs no words, only connection to source. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="divider-sm"></div><div class="container"><div class="row d-flex justify-content-center mt-3"><div class="col-12 col-md-6 text-center"><div class="fs-5">I believe that at our core we are energy - a pure life force that shapes our entire world.
