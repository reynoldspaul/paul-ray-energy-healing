Other people’s emotions and problems land at our feet, and being highly sensitive empaths, we take on these things as if they are our own. </p><p> Our natural inclination is to offer support and compassion which are indeed noble attributes. But in this process we deplete our own energy, our own prana, our own life force. We become burnt out, exhausted, resentful and in desperate need of restoring ourselves to balance. </p></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-5"><img src="'+t+'" style="width:100%;"></div></div></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="section-bg-colour"><div class="container py-5"><div class="row justify-content-between py-5"><div class="col-12 col-md-5"><img src="'+o+'" style="width:100%;"></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6"><div class="text-primary title">Reiki is the healer</div><div class="fs-5"><p> I provide Reiki in a safe space for you to reconnect with yourself, in order to allow your own energy to heal the parts of you it knows it needs to. To express in ways it needs to, to be seen in ways it needs to, to flow in ways it needs to, to release that which isn’t yours, and ultimately to bring you back into balance so you can show up in your own life with ease, peace and joy. </p><p>Taking steps on your own path of healing is not always easy. It can be a scary and sometimes lonely road. But one thing’s for sure - it is always incredibly rewarding. I admire the courage in anyone willing to explore their inner world, and I look forward to meeting you for your own Reiki session that will be as unique as you are. </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row my-5"><div class="col text-center"><a href="https://paulray.setmore.com/" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg px-5 py-3">Book A Reiki Session</a></div></div></div>',9))}const d=i(a,[["render",n]]);export{d as default};
